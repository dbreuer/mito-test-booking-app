## Used Libraries



## What is my verdict?
- Home screen style aligments with the design.

    For the simplicity, I choosed the Material UI component for the Autocomplete and Date picker. Just it doesn not work well with the nextjs Serverside rendering, so it would require further workaround to ignore or transfer the serverside style. If I add the variant outlined it swill show the errors.

    In additional date picker behavior should change so the modal opened by defult when the user click in the input field.
